### Regulator formats
Yaml was chosen as the data format for documenting regulator caracteristics.
Mostly for readability.


### Data collection
Web scrappers could be written to automatically generate regulator specs form
sites such as *Digikey*. Visual fitting tools could also be implemented to
extract efficiencies from graphs in datasheets.
